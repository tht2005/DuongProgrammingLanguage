# Duong's compiler
## About
	My basic compiler for learning.
## Build
	Install Make
	$ ./make
After that you'll get your compiler in `bin` directory.
## Run
	# from the project's directory
	$ cd bin
	$ duong <filename>



## Basic syntax
This is your basic programming code in duong:
```
main()
	write "Hello, World!"
```	
Like C/C++, the program should start at the `main()` function.
